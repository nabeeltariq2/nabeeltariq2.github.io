What's this Git about?
I am currently pursuing a Masters degree: MS in Business Analytics (MSBA) from Goizueta Business School, Emory University. My course covers topics in Data Analytics (Machine Learning, Managing Big Data, Social Networks, Data Visualization and others), teaching us various Analytics Techniques (Classification, Regression and more) using multiple Programming Languages (R, Python, SQL and others) and Analytics Tools (Tableau, RapidMiner, and more).

This GitHub is just a collection of my random (and not so random) attempts to create something meaningful - through coding and other stuff that I'm learning - out of nothing :)
